# Agent Guidance

## Workspace Commands

ALWAYS prefer these commands over using `cargo ...` or `rustfmt ...` directly. Only
fall-back to custom tool calls if necessary.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `just build` | Build the workspace |
| `just lint` | Lint the workspace (incl. `rustfmt` check) |
| `just test` | Run workspace tests |

`just test` accepts nextest filters and a few agent-friendly output modes:

- `just test <filter>` runs matching tests.
- `just test --summary <filter>` prints only the nextest header and summary.
- `just test --failures <filter>` prints failing tests and captured failure
  output.
- `just test --results <filter>` prints per-test pass/fail statuses without
  captured success output.
- Add `--no-sccache` when the sandbox blocks the configured compiler cache.
  This is supported by `just build`, `just install`, `just lint`,
  `just fix`, and `just test`.

## Coding Style

Write clear, concise, idiomatic and best-practice-driven code for any given
language.

### Rust

### LLM Prompts

When engineering LLM/agent prompts:

- Be mindful of token usage; optimize wording to be clear and concise with high
  signal density.
- Avoid repeating what's already been stated in the document. If you find
  yourself doing this, it may indicate that a structural refactor is necessary
  to preserve density; if so, propose your suggestion(s) to the user.

## Documentation

Follow these rules when writing any documentation, both in code and dedicated
files:

- Avoid long, drawn-out and overexplained documentation; be clear but concise,
  focusing on the important details of the item being documented.
